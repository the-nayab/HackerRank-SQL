/**

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:



Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input



Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
Explanation

Values in the tuple  form an Isosceles triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  form an Equilateral triangle, because . Values in the tuple  form a Scalene triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides  and  is not larger than that of side .

Solution:

select
case 
    when A=B and B=C then "Equilateral"
    when A != B and A!= C and B != C and ( A+B > C and A+C > B and B+C > A )  then "Scalene"
    when (A=B and A!=C and A+B>C) or (A=C and A!=B and A+C>B) or (C=B and C!=A and B+C>A) then "Isosceles"
    else "Not A Triangle"
